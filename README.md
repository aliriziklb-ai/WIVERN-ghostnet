# WIVERN-ghostnet
Deep learning framework for ghost-echo correction and reconstruction in WIVERN Doppler radar reflectivity profiles, developed within the ESA-Earth Explorer 11 WIVERN mission. Implements CNN-BiLSTM, 1D U-Net, and 2D U-Net architectures for denoising and calibration of WIVERN mission radar profiles using large-scale NetCDF simulations.
